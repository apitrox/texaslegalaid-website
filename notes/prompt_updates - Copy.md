- Next to the household size label, put a help icon (like other help icons in our application) with a tooltip that reads "This is the total number of people, adults and children, who live in your household. If one of the people who live in the household pays child support for any child/ren that do not live in the household, also include that child/ren.".
- Next to the household income label, put a help icon (like other help icons in our application) with a tooltip that reads "This is the total amount of income earned on average, from all people who live in your household. This is gross income, before deducting any taxes, withholdings, etc.".
- After the user has entered the household size and household income, calculate their poverty percent using current year (or latest year if current year is not available) HHS poverty numbers. Display the poverty number as a percent, and rounded to the nearest whole percent. Recalculate whenever one of the numbers is changed. The label shall be "Poverty percent: " and the number shall be displayed like 104%. Use poverty guidelines for the 48 Continguous States or assume the person lives in Texas. Use this API endpoint ``https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines/api/[YEAR]/[STATE]/[HOUSEHOLD_SIZE]`` If you don't get valid data returned using the current year, then use the previous year, particularly if it is during the first couple months of the current year. Then, divide the user's household income by the amount returned by the api call (which is 100% poverty level), multiply by 100, round to the nearest whole number, and this is our percent poverty level. Display this number and remember it in memory.
