For the `texaslegalaid-website` application website project make the following changes:
- Our primary objective is to replicate the Texas Family Help Link online intake application located on the Texas Law Help at `https://texaslawhelp.org/family-help-link` onto the Texas Legal Aid website at `https://texaslegalaid.org/family-help-link.html`. 
- See any attached image(s) or file(s) for reference with this conversation. 
- Attached are a couple images from our Texas Legal Aid application, from beginning steps of the online intake application. Then there are several images from the online Texas Law Help application asking for children, parties, and other contact information, culminating by telling the user that there are no matching organizations. Build pages in our Texas Legal Aid online application to replicate the pages and page flow in the Texas Law Help online application.

General Rules:
- This is `texaslegalaid-website` application website, a mobile-first, AMP-compatible legal aid intake portal that connects individuals seeking legal assistance with appropriate legal aid providers. The platform serves as both a public-facing intake system and a secure provider portal. 
- `../notes/application-specifications.md` contains specifications that are to be followed whenever making updates to this application website. When prompted, before making any updates read and understand and then when making updates follow the application specifications. All changes must comply with the specifications contained in `../notes/application-specifications`. 
- `..\.claude\settings.json` contains Claude Code permissions for file operations. Load these permissions at the beginning of each conversation and apply them throughout the conversation. 
- Before making any changes, ask me any clarifying questions you may have. Give me multiple-choice options for answers whenever possible. If you do not know something that you need, ask me even if during execution of the implementation plan or updates.
- Before making any changes, create an implementation plan and then execute the plan. Do not ask me to review or approve the plan, just proceed with the plan.
- Use multiple agents to execute large implementation plans that are too long for one agent.
- When making changes to `../apply-online.html` always update `../notes/apply-online-page-flow.md` so that it accurately reflects the current page flow of `../apply-online.html`. 
- When making changes to `../family-help-link.html` always update `../notes/family-help-link-page-flow.md` so that it accurately reflects the current page flow of `../family-help-link.html`. 
- As part of the changes, always update sitemap.xml and all other objects, including full AMP-compatibility, related to SEO that may be impacted with the changes. 
- The git repository for this project is at `https://github.com/apitrox/texaslegalaid-website`. Pull from GitHub before making any code changes. Commit and Push to GitHub after finishing code changes. Work directly on the `main` branch. 
- Upon completion, delete any project files whose name starts with "tmpclaude-" and then promptly display a notice that the process is complete and provide a summary of what was done.
