      <p class="mb-2">LegalLine is a community service outreach program created by the Houston Bar Association in 1985. This hotline is designed to help the people of Houston receive simple legal advice, answers to legal questions, and referrals to helpful resources over the telephone, at no cost to the caller. Callers may ask questions on any legal topic.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">All calls are answered by licensed attorneys. Their volunteer attorneys specialize in a variety of fields. The volunteers remain anonymous.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">No appointment is necessary; just place your call while the program is taking place. They accept phone calls only — not in-person visits.
