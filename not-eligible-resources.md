**FREE LEGAL AID AND NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS**

**Local Legal Aid Offices** — Texas is a big state. We have 254 counties, more than any other state. It takes three local legal aid organizations to serve our state — they are broken up by geographic area below. Legal Aid organizations typically have income cutoffs for the applicants they accept as clients. However, the responses you provided in this form indicate that your income is at or below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines, which means you very likely qualify based on income. Income is not the sole determinant of eligibility, though. So, it's best to contact your legal provider directly to better understand their qualification guidelines.
