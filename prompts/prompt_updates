For the `texaslegalaid-website` project make the following changes:
- Change the image from one image into a carousel of images. Always start with `TLA_Hero_Square_Man_In_Wheelchair.png` and leave it displayed for double-time, then rotate through `TLA_Hero_Square_Woman_Eviction_Notice.png`, `TLA_Hero_Square_Man_Immigration_Arrest.png`, `TLA_Hero_Square_Woman_Domesic_Violence.png`, `TLA_Hero_Square_Couple_Flooded.png`, `TLA_Hero_Square_Woman_On_Porch.png`.
- Before making any changes, ask me any clarifying questions you may have. Give me multiple-choice options for answers whenever possible. If you do not know something that you need, ask me even if during your updates.
- Before making any changes, create an implementation plan and then execute the plan. Do not ask me to review or approve the plan, just proceed with the plan.
- As part of the changes, always update sitemap.xml and all other objects related to SEO that may be impacted with the changes.
- Pull from GitHub before making any code changes. Commit and Push to GitHub after finishing code changes. Work directly on the `main` branch.
