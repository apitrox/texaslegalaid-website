# Legal Aid Application Website - Comprehensive Build Prompt

---

## Project Overview

Build **myLegalAid** — a mobile-first, AMP-compatible national legal aid centralized intake website that connects individuals seeking legal assistance with appropriate legal aid providers using AI. The platform serves as both a public-facing accessibility, informational, and intake system for clients, as well as a secure provider management hub.

This is going to start out as a prototype with excellent UX but doesn't require all complex functionality to start with - it can be built out later. Images must be stellar. It must look very impressive and show what functionality will be available, even if some or much of the backend functionality is not built out at first.

This service/site will operate state-by-state, with Texas being the first state online.

The project aims to establish a centralized intake system for legal services in Texas, simplifying access for vulnerable individuals. It seeks to create one online portal and a toll-free phone access for intake across all practice areas, reducing barriers for clients seeking legal assistance. 

One intake system that can be accessed either through an online intake form or by phone.  Each provider will have a profile that includes a real-time "Capacity Meter." The Capacity Meter will be a tool that allows provider organizations to set parameters regarding their current priorities and capacity to take cases, specifically about which practice areas, geographic areas and level of service would be appropriate at any given time.

This will ensure that clients are sent to organizations where they are eligible for service, and who have the capacity to serve them, and that cases are triaged to get the appropriate level of service that they need. 

Provider organizations should realize huge savings as client intake activities will be done for them, allowing the provider to reallocate resources from intake to providing services. 

The intake system will employ guiding intake referral principles, essential scripts for proper intake across subject matter areas, continued feedback about the intake and referral process, and updates to the provider's Capacity Meter through the secure provider portal. Each provider can specify in their provider portal how they would like to receive referrals, by automated email, text message and/or industry standard webhook directly to their case management system. There will also be reporting capabilities available in the provider portal. Emergency cases or cases that require special attention could be routed to an attorney or designated person.

The intake system will can also assist clients with legal information and is expected to leverage the texaslawhelp.org website for this information.

Some of the most legal areas where vulnerable people need assistance include immigration, family law, domestic violence, housing and disability rights.

The intake system will be able to answer an unlimited number of calls, on the first ring, 24/7/365, in 32 languages. The system can be accessed either by calling a phone number or by using an online voice chat. With this AI intake system there is no need for retraining - an AI agent can be very quickly trained and it never forgets or needs retraining. There is never brain drain, call offs, bad days, etc.

When a legal aid service provider accesses their portal, one of the things they will be able to do is create service pods. For each service pod the provider can set a geographic area, legal area(s), referral capacity, whether it is information only, advice and counsel, brief services, or full representation, whether it is available only virtually or also in person, what language capacity is available, and what other accessibility can be provided for the client. Each provider can create any number of service pods for themself.  When a client completes an intake application and is deemed eligible for legal aid services, they will be referred to the provider if the client and their legal needs meet the provider's criteria specified in one of their service pods.

This system signifies a bold, forward-thinking approach to addressing systemic inequities and advancing access to justice. Through collaborative partnerships, innovative solutions, and a commitment to continuous improvement, the centralized intake project seeks to create a more inclusive and accessible legal aid ecosystem that serves the diverse needs of Texans across the state-removing the burden form the client the right resource, and shifting it to the providers. We believe that with innovative technology, applicants who we currently don't have capacity to serve can receive an answer quickly and get automated information and resources for self-help, thereby increasing the system's capacity and gain a sense of procedural justice for the client who would not otherwise be served.

This intake system can easily incorporate the intake requirements other programs and initiatives such as the Access and Visitation Hotline, Survivors of Sexual Assault (LASSA) program, Eviction Helpline programs, Veterans assistance programs, the South Central Pension Rights Project, Legal Hotline for Texans, Family hotline, Parenting Order Legal Line (POLL), MLP Program, and it can efficiently operate the intake portal for child welfare cases. The AI Agents can be quickly trained to assist in any subject matter area.

The system also provides an online intake application like what is found at [General Intake Online Form](https://www.tlsc.org/generalintake) and [Texas Family Help Link Online Intake Form](https://texaslawhelp.org/family-help-link).

This intake system is infinitely scalable, highly adaptible and ultimately sustainable. The system requires zero infrastructure additions or modifications by providers.

The anticipated impact of the Centralized Intake Project is multifaceted and holds the potential to significantly improve access to legal services for vulnerable Texans across the state. First, by streamlining the access to legal aid in Texas through a unified online portal and toll-free telephone system, the project aims to reduce barriers and enhance the ease of access for individuals seeking legal assistance. This streamlined approach will reduce or even eliminate the need for clients to navigate multiple intake systems, thereby saving time and reducing frustration. Additionally, the system addresses existing inefficiencies within the access to justice service delivery model by centralizing intake operations and optimizing resource allocation. Through the implementation of a provider service pods and the Capacity Meter tool, providers will be able to make real-time updates on their capacity to accept cases, ensuring that clients are efficiently matched with service providers who can meet their needs. 

Furthermore, the project aims to generate important and reliable data about client needs and the justice gap in Texas. By tracking and analyzing intake metrics, such as call volume, case acceptance rates, and reasons for rejection, the project will provide valuable insights into the demand for legal services and the ability of providers to respond. This data-driven approach will inform ongoing improvements to the intake and referral process, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and allocate resources more effectively. 

By leveraging technology, collaboration, and data-driven insights, this intake system streamlines the intake process, enhances service delivery, and ultimately, improve access to justice for vulnerable Texans. Through ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and process improvement, the AI technologies will continue to adapt and evolve, ensuring that it remains responsive to the needs of the community and delivers sustainable impact over the long term. 

We will ensure we are "closing the loop" on referrals by following up on any rejected referral or one that remains pending so that the volume of clients actually served should line up with the number of referrals made. We will also conduct ongoing client satisfaction surveys and partner feedback surveys to inform our QA processes and improve our services and systems. This will be done with automated AI agents that have unlimited capacity.

Legal Aid providers in Texas are committed to ensuring that clients are served in a trauma-informed, culturally competent, and efficient manner. Centralized intake furthers these goals by shifting the burden from the client to find the right resource to the legal aid community, reducing the re-trauma that clients often endure in our current system. 

This application is designed to be inclusive of and relevant to all legal aid providers in Texas, starting with the three LSC funded entities in Texas as well as Disability Rights Texas and the Texas Immigration Law Council, and Texas A&M University, moving to include all TAJF grantees, and finally opening up to any remaining legal aid providers in Texas.

Somewhere on the Legal Aid website should be mentions and links to [Qualifying for Legal Aid](https://texaslawhelp.org/qualifying-for-legal-aid), [Assisted Pro Se Services](https://texaslawhelp.org/assisted-pro-se-services), [Professional Use Only Legal Forms](https://texaslawhelp.org/warning-forms-for-professional-use)

## Prompt Summary

> Build a mobile-first, AMP-compatible legal aid intake portal called MyLegalAid. The site connects people seeking legal help with appropriate providers. The site performs all the intake and eligibility requirements to free up the provider to focus on providing world-class service. This also allows a person seeking legal aid assistance to complete a single intake application for all providers rather than going through the process of completing an intake application for each provider. The intake application will be highly automated and easy and efficient for the client to use - it will utilize conversational AI, text messaging and online tools that are all mobile friendly. including: (1) SEO optimized — SEO optimized for both search bots and AI to maximize the likelihood that a person looking online for legal assistance will be referred to the site; (2) Conversational AI client portal — clients can speak with a human-like AI agent 24/7 in multiple languages to complete an intake application, tracking cases, and access additional resources; (3) Client follow-up — automated followup with clients for intake completion, service satisfaction, etc.; (4) Secure online provider portal — dashboard, referral management, profile/criteria settings, real-time utilization of profile settings. Use Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap, prioritize 90% mobile usage, implement full SEO with Schema.org markup, ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, and create a "calm authority" design aesthetic with trust blue and warm gold colors. Phase 1 is a functional prototype with stellar UX and realistic interactions, deferring backend integration to a later phase. All images should feel authentic and hopeful, never generic stock.
