              <p class="text-yellow-700">Using this Site does not create an attorney-client relationship between
                you and Texas Legal Aid. An attorney-client relationship is only formed when a legal aid provider
                accepts your case and you sign an engagement agreement with that provider. Use of this Site or contacting us

              Contacting us or submitting a request to us does not guarantee that you will receive legal assistance 
              or that a legal aid provider will take your case. Legal aid providers have limited capacity and are often selective with 
              regard to the types of cases they will take. We make no guarantees or warranties regarding the 
              availability or quality of legal services from any legal aid provider.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Free legal aid services are typically available to individuals who meet certain income guidelines. Eligibility 
              is ultimately determined by individual legal aid providers based on their funding requirements, capacity, 
              priorities, and other factors. We do not represent that you will qualify for free legal aid services.

              INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER

              You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Texas Legal Aid, and its 
              respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims,

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              For any claim or dispute you have involving Texas Legal Aid, you agree to submit to 
              binding arbitration. Binding arbitration shall take place in Harris County, Texas, or as otherwise 
              agreed by all parties. The party who brings the claim or dispute shall be entirely responsible for 
              prompt payment of all fees and costs associated with arbitration (arbitrator, filing or initiation, 
              facilities, court reporter, administrative, travel, expert witnesses, transcription, record preparation, 
              and any other arbitration-related costs), with the exception that each party shall be responsible for 
              their own attorneys' fees unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the arbitrator, and 
              failure to do so shall result in dismissal or loss of the claim or dispute. Both parties must agree 
              on the arbitrator and rules of arbitration, or in the absence of such an agreement the arbitration 
              shall either be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association or 
              as determined by Texas Legal Aid. In the absence of an agreement of an arbitrator, 
              the arbitrator may be selected by Texas Legal Aid.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary-700 mb-4">16. Severability</h2>

              If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions 
              shall remain in full force and effect.
            </p>
